This is my first ever JavaScript app written.
I know the code may be inefficient in places,
and I didn't know object-oriented programming yet.
I left this intact to see how much I knew back
then and how much better I know now.

I plan to re-write this soon, using transforms
to add 3D tile flipping, and to add "classes"
and such.
